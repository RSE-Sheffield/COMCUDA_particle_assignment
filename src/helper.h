/*
 * These helper methods can be use to check validity of individual stages of your algorithm
 * Pass the required component to the validate_?() methods for it's validation status to be printed to console
 * Pass the required components to the skip_?() methods to have the reference implementation perform the step.
 * For the CUDA algorithm, this will require copying data back to the host. You CANNOT pass device pointers to these methods.
 *
 * Pointers passed to helper methods must point to memory which has been allocated in the same format as CPU.c
 *
 * Some images will have limited/no errors when performed incorrectly, it's best to validate with a wide range of images.
 *
 * Do not use these methods during benchmark runs, as they will invalidate the timing.
